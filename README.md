Hooks - they are normal js function with specfic use case

Whenever State variables updates, react triggers a reconciliation cycle (re-render the component)

Whenever a function start with use its a hook in react

React uses Client side Routing not Server side Routing

Never comapre React life Cycle method to functional component

return in useEffect if done it will be called while on unmounting component

HOC are pure functions
